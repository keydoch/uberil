            <p>Description: A scriptorium in Uberil is a gathering place of Wizards and masters of the arcane. They contain vast halls filled with knowledge and spells beyond reason. They are often state owned and regulated.</p>
            <p>Frequency: Most kingdoms have scriptoriums in their larger cities. They tend to be sparsely spread, and it is rare to find more than 2 scriptoriums in a non-wizard governed kingdom. For those kingdoms that are governed by a magistrate of Wizards you will find a minimum of 1 in every village and city, varying in size based on the economy. </p>
            <p>Admission: All magically inclined pupils and citizens can file for admission into a state regulated or privately owned scriptorium free of charge. Once admitted they are required to take a test to gauge magical abilities and knowledge; you cannot fail this test. Once aptitude or knowledge has been ranked you will be assigned a position in the scriptorium.</p>
            <p>Positions: Positions vary from kingdom to kingdom, but have a few core unchanging characteristics (bar a few odd instances). Scriptoriums will always pay a fixed salary based upon your position, though this pay and position name and value differs between every country. You will be obligated to work a minimum number of hours for the scriptorium or state in exchange for your salary. You must accept a minimum number of requests in order to maintain your position.</p>
            <p>Rewards: In exchange for your service you will receive the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Standard to secret information on locations around you; this information varies based on your position and country.</li>
              <li>Spells and alchemy recipes for heavily discounted prices.</li>
              <li>Respect from the scriptoriums the country varying on position.</li>
              <li>Assistance in the creation of spells.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note: There are rewards not listed here that are extremely high for upper positions. You may be given nobility and land, or a team to assist you.</p>
