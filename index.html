        <h2>A Homebrew Adventure</h2>
        <p>Uberil is a hombrew setting developed by Joe Gillette (me) that alters the construction of locations, lore, and planes/dimensions in the D&D 5th Edition(5e) world. The changes are not to detract from D&D 5e content in any way shape or form, but rather to make things more cohesive or distinct for the player. The content provided on this website is completely free to use and transmit amongst personal groups and is not an officially licensed product (obviously), so use at your own risk or pleasure. My apologies for waffling on but I found it necessary to provide further legal seperation.</p>
        <p>If you wish to post any requests for official changes or additions please contact <span style="color:red;">rilvontechnologies@gmail.com</span>, or for faster responses my personal email: <span style="color:red;">gosarcreates@pm.me</span> Good luck on your adventures traveler!</p>
